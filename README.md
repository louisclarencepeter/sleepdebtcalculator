# sleepdebtcalculator
This code calculates the amount of sleep someone got in a week based on the number of hours they slept each day of the week. It then compares the actual sleep hours to the ideal sleep hours and prints a message indicating whether the user got the perfect amount of sleep, overslept, or got less sleep than they needed.
